1.  Why is there a thin shell of emission
  surrounded by a diffuse 'ring'?

2.  EW of emission is sensitive to slit
  coverage of the wind.  Even a slit at 50%
  only shows ~1/2 of the emission.  The 
  actual luminosity is going to be a complicated
  function of the wind geometry, kinematics and
  slit size.  All the more motivation for an IFU.
  
3.  What is the emission profile at v=0 km/s in 
  Kate's object?

4.  The emission can fill in the absorption, 
  on the red wing.

5. Absorption EW peaks at 0.25 slit width, 
  probably to get sufficient Dv.  It reaches
  zero EW at ~0.9 width
