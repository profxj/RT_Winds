In order to run the Monte carlo code, you will have to compile the gsl
library.  Go into the gsl-1.9 directory and try "./configure" then
"make".  You can also do a "make install" if you want it somewhere it
can be seen easily.

For more information go to:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

You will also need an mpi compiler (even if do not plan on running things
in parallel.).  A standard packakge is mpich2, which is often already 
installed on your machine.  IF not you can download and install at:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/

The meat of the code is in the file outflow.cc.  All the model
parameters are set at the beginning of that file.  You need to
recompile the code each time you change a parameter.

The density and velocity structures are set in the functions
Get_Velocity() and Get_Density() in outflow.cc.  Right now these are
set as power-laws, but It should be straightforward to change them to
whatever you want.

The final spectrum is output as "spec.dat"

We can consider dust and other additions later.

Let me know if you have any problems getting it to run.
