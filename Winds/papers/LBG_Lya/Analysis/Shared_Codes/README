This set of codes is intended to be used
in all of the routines related to LBG-Lya emission.

Modifications from PKR11:
  1.  New Voigt algorithm (approximate; good to 1%)
  2.  Added emit_line.cc
    -- Algorithm to modify the intrinsic emission spectrum
    from a simple continuum to a Gaussian line :: EW (A), sigma(cm/s)
