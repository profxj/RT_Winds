1.  Make sure the Voigt profile is "right"
  In Grid models too (there it is a simple approx)
2.  Make sure the velocity dispersion in the clump 
  model has an effect
3. Extend 1D LBG covering models to 300kpc
4. You can only scatter as much as you absorb!
  -- Intrinsically, not as "observed"
5. Do I need to integrate the SB in annuli (probably not)
6. Discuss Tremonti
