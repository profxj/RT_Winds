Editor Conselice,

We have read carefully the (brief) report on our paper titled
"Simple Models of Metal-Line Absorption and Emission from Cool Gas Outflows"
that we submitted to the Astrophysical Journal.  The referee has offered
a few suggestions on how to revise the paper which we have implemented.
These are detailed below.  Hopefully the paper now meets the standards
of ApJ.

Sincerely,

X

<<Fig 11: Would be nice to see the canonical exp(-tau_d) curve forcomparison.
 
We have added such a curve to the figure and have modified the figure caption accordingly. 

<<sec 5.1: It is claimed that the S10 model does not match S10's data whena proper treatment of
<<re-emission is done. It would be useful to havesome representation of the S10 data on Figure 15 
<<to allow a more directcomparison by the reader (since I for one am not intimately familiar withthe data). 
<<In particular, what observed features are not reproduced by this model?

We prefer not to include data on this Figure, in part because we have avoided direct 
comparisons to data (including our own) throughout the manuscript, in part because 
the figure is already a little cluttered, and because we don't even have the spectrum to show.  
Instead, we have included additional text to the manuscript detailing the features that are 
not reproduced by this model (e.g. strong emission).

<<For this model, the authors quote a mass in the wind of 10^10 Mo.Fig 16 shows a wind mass of ~few x 10^8 at 100 kpc. 
<<Is the majority ofthe wind's mass beyond this? Also, while a mass of 10^10 Mo in a windsounds like a surprising number, 
<<the mass loss rates likely are comparableto or exceed the SFR, which means that if the wind is operating over 
<<10^8 or maybe even 10^7 yrs, then 10^10 Mo is not at all implausible.
<<These timescales are plausible for a wind to travel ~100 kpc.

This was (and may still be) a bit confusing.  There were two calculations done.
One is for the LBG-Sobolev model and is shown in Fig 16.  The other is for the
clump model and we only report a mass estimate in the text.  For the clumps,
one gets a significantly higher mass.  We have made this point more clear now.
Also, we have struck the line "We question whether this is a plausible result
form star-formation driven feedback." which addresses the other points
raised by the referee.
