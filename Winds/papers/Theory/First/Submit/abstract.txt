We analyze the absorption and emission-line profiles produced by a set
of simple, cool gas wind models motivated by galactic-scale outflow
observations. We implement monte carlo radiative
transfer techniques that track the propagation of scattered and
fluorescent photons to generate 1D spectra and 2D spectral images.
We focus on the \mgiid\ doublet and \ion{Fe}{2} UV1
multiplet at $\lambda \approx 2600$\AA, but the results are applicable
to other transitions that trace outflows (e.g.\ \ion{Na}{1},
\ion{H}{1} \lya, \ion{Si}{2}).   
By design, the resonance transitions show blue-shifted
absorption but one also predicts strong resonance and fine-structure line-emission at roughly
the systemic velocity.  This line-emission `fills-in' the absorption
reducing the equivalent width by up to $50\%$, shift the
absorption-lin centroid by tens of \kms, and 
reduce the effective
opacity near systemic.  Analysis of cool gas outflows that ignores this
line-emission may incorrectly infer that the gas is partially
covered, measure a significantly lower peak optical depth, and/or
conclude that gas at systemic velocity is absent   
(e.g.\ an interstellar or slowly infalling component). 
Because the \ion{Fe}{2} lines
are connected by optically-thin transitions to
fine-structure levels, their profiles
more closely reproduce the intrinsic opacity
of the wind.   Together these results naturally explain the
absorption and emission-line characteristics observed for star-forming
galaxies at $z<1$.
We also study a scenario promoted to describe the outflows
of $z \sim 3$ Lyman break galaxies and 
find prfiles inconsistent with the observations due to scattered
photon emission.
Although line-emission complicates the analysis of absorption-line
profiles, the 
surface brightness profiles 
offer a unique means of assessing the morphology and size
of galactic-scale winds.  Furthermore, the kinematics and line-ratios
offer powerful diagnostics of outflows,  motivating deep,
spatially-extended spectroscopic observations.
