1. Include Dan's calculation of minimum depth for line profile  ~ r_wind/r_source
2. Rerun the fiducial models with the 'proper' r_source value
3. Label kpc on the other axis of the RHS boxes
	4. Do a range of b-values
5. Make sure the inner bounday is not absorbing any photons in the non-ISM models
6. Discuss the launching radius in the text (1D and 3D are a bit different in that all the 1D come from r_emit whereas the 3D probably comes from a range)
7. Rerun all models with sufficient photons (e.g. ISM)
8. Fix the bug in the FeII emission for the ISM model
9. Add dust to all the power-law models
10. Do a SiII 1526 calculation for the LBG model?
11. Do an INFALL model
12. Put dust in the ISM model
13. Modify the optical depths of the fiducial model

101. Worry about the Voigt profile
102. Write methodology sub-section
103. Suggest other variants + models
104. Correct any/all of my radiation lingo
105. Check for a bug in the asymmetric emission maps?
