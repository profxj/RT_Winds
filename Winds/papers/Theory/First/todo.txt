Xavier
	1. Include Dan's calculation of minimum depth for line profile  ~ r_wind/r_source
	2. Rerun the fiducial models with the 'proper' r_source value
	3. Label kpc on the other axis of the RHS boxes
	4. Do a range of b-values
	5. Make sure the inner bounday is not absorbing any photons in the non-ISM models
6. Discuss the launching radius in the text (1D and 3D are a bit different in that all the 1D come from r_emit whereas the 3D probably comes from a range)
	7. Rerun all models with sufficient photons (e.g. ISM)
	8. Fix the bug in the FeII emission for the ISM model
9. Add dust to all the power-law models
10. Do a SiII 1526 calculation for the LBG model?
11. Do an INFALL model
12. Put dust in the ISM model
13. Modify the optical depths of the fiducial model
14. Make a bigger deal about the 2600/2586 inversion in the ISM case
	15. Redo all FeII models with l_start = 2573 and l_stop = 2639
16. Show an instrument 'smoothed' (e.g. LRIS) profile (or two)
17. Consider (again) whether v_doppler is done right for re-remitted photons
18. Discuss FeII* 2626/2632 blending
	19. Fix labels on the Obs v_f plot
20. Use 1D fiducial model for all but the IFU plots
21. Move Sobolev discussion up to fiducial model
22. Consider a Martin+Bouche model with high dust
23. Add to Intro:  
  What has (not) been done previously
     -- Scattered light
     -- Flourescence
     -- Funny treatment of Sobolev
     -- Spatial extent
  Discuss NaI emission
24. Produce a bi-conical model
25. Note the source cannot absorb photons
26. Put FeII* 'calculation' in the Methodology section
27. "Observe" the fiducial model through LRIS

---------------------
Dan
---------------------
	101. Worry about the Voigt profile
102. Write methodology sub-section
103. Suggest other variants + models
104. Correct any/all of my radiation lingo (e.g. resonance vs resonant; scattering vs. re-emission [flourescence])
105. Check for a bug in the asymmetric emission maps?
106. Help X get a 2D map of the LBG emission


---------------------
Kate
---------------------
1001. Improve Intro
1002. Suggest other references
1003. Consider other ways to compare to observations
1004. Suggest other variants + models

===========================
Models to run (or rerun)
=========================== 
	Fiducial (MgII, FeII)
Fiducial with tau varying (MgII, FeII) 
	ISM
	ISM with dust
Dust models enough times to 'fit' flux vs tau_d
LBG
LBG with dust [tau ~ distance]
LBG in '3D'
Doppler
Power-laws (some) with dust
