1. Include Dan's calculation of minimum depth for line profile  ~ r_wind/r_source
2. Rerun the fiducial models with the 'proper' r_source value
3. Label kpc on the other axis of the RHS boxes
4. Do a range of b-values
5. Make sure the inner bounday is not absorbing any photons in the non-ISM models
6. Discuss the launching radius in the text (1D and 3D are a bit different in that all the 1D come from r_emit whereas the 3D probably comes from a range)
7. Rerun all models with sufficient photons (e.g. ISM)
8. Fix the bug in the FeII emission for the ISM model
