\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{The Radiative Transitions}

[Table of $f,\lambda,A,\gamma$]

In this paper, we will focus on two sets of radiative transitions
associated with the Fe$^+$ and Mg$^+$ ions, a choice motivated by 
our own observations \citep{rubin10b}.  Although this is a limited
set, the two ions and their transitions have 
characteristics that resemble the properties for the majority of low-ions 
observed in cool-gas outflows. [wording still stinks] Therefore, many
of our results may be generalized to other studies.

The Mg$^+$ ion, with a single 3s electron in the ground-state,
exhibits an alkali doublet of transitions similar to the
\lya\ transitions of neutral hydrogen.  In Figure~\ref{fig:energy}
we present the energy level diagram for this 
\mgiid\ doublet.  In non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, the 2p$^6$3p level is said to be split by spin-orbit
coupling which produces the line doublet.  These are the only
\ion{Mg}{2} electric-dipole transitions 
with wavelengths near 2800\AA. Also, the transtion connecting
the $\rm {}^2P_{3/2}$ and $\rm {}^2P_{1/2}$ states is forbidden by several
selection rules.  Therefore, an absorption from
2p$^6$^3s~$\to$~2p$^6$3p 
is followed nearly 100$\%$ of the time by a spontaneous decay to the
ground state and our treatment will ignore any other possibilities
(e.g.\ absorption of a second photon).

The physics of the \mgiid\ doublet
is analagous to the physics of \ion{H}{1}
\lya, the \naid\ doublet, and many other doublets commonly
studied in the ISM and IGM.  These doublets differ only in
the transiton wavelengths and the energy of the doublet separation. 
For \ion{H}{1} \lya, the
separation is sufficiently small ($\Delta v = c \Delta E / E \approx
1.3 \mkms$) that most radiative transfer treatments actually ignore the fact that
there are two transitions.   This is generally a justifiable
assumption because 
most astrophysical processes have turbulent motions that
significantly exceed this velocity separation and effectively mix the
two transitions.  For \ion{Mg}{2} ($\Delta v \approx 770 \, \mkms$),  
\ion{Na}{1} ($\Delta v \approx 304 \, \mkms$), and most of the other doublets
commonly studied the separations are large and the lines
must be treated separately.  Regarding analysis of outflows, the line
separation plays an important role when the outflow speed $\mvr
\gtrsim \Delta v$.

Iron exhibits the most complex set of energy levels of the elements
frequently studied in astrophysics.  The Fe$^+$ ion alone has over XXX
energy levels recorded \citep{iron}, and even this is an
incomplete list.  
One reason for the complexity of iron is
that the majority of its configurations exhibit fine-structure splitting.
This includes the ground-state configuration (\aconfig) which is split
into 5 levels with 
excitation energies $T_{\rm ex} \equiv \Delta E / k$ ranging from
$T_{\rm{ex} \approx
500-1500$\,K.  These levels are usually labelled by the total angular momentum
$J$, with the ground-state having $J=9/2$ (Figure~\ref{fig:energy}).  
Transitions between these fine-structure levels are 
forbidden (magnetic-dipole) with spontaneous decay times of several hours.  

In this paper, we will focus on transitions between the ground-state
configuration and the levels associated with the \zconfig\
configuration.  This set of transitions are named the
UV1 mutliplet with wavelengths near 2600\AA.
There are two resonance-line transitions (defined to originate in the
true ground-state) associated with this multiplet, \feiid,
corresponding to $\Delta J = 0, -1$.  The solid (green) downward
arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:energy} mark the transitions that connect to
the upper energy levels of the resonance lines.  These transitons can
occur following the absorption of a single photon by the ion in its
ground-state.  

The Figure also shows (as dashed downward arrows) two of the
transitions that connect to higher energy levels of the \zconfig\
configuration.  Radiatively, these can only occur after the absorption
of two photons: one to raise the electron from the ground-state to an
excited state and one from the excited state to one of the \zconfig\
levels with $J \le 5/2$.  The excitation of the Fe$^+$ ion by the
absorption of UV photons is termed indirect UV pumping
\citep[e.g][]{sv02,pcb06} and requires the ion to lie
near an intense source of UV photons (see $\S$~\ref{sec:pump}).  In the
following, we will assume that this does not occur and that only the 
true ground-state is populated by electrons. 

Our calculations also ignore collisional
processes\footnote{Recombination is also ignored.}, i.e.\ collisional
excitation and de-excitation of the various levels.  For the
fine-structure levels of the \aconfig\ configuration, the excitation
energies are modest ($T_{\rm ex} \sim 1000$\,K) but the critical
density $n_c$ is very large.  For the \aconfig$_{9/2} \to
$\aconfig$_{7/2}$ transition, the critical density $n_c \approx XX
\cm{-3}$.  At these densities, one would predict significant (and
detectable) quantities of \ion{Fe}{1} which has not yet been observed
\citep[see also][]{pcb06}.  The strongest arguement for neglecting
collisions is the general absence of {\it absorption} from the
fine-structure levels of the \aconfig\ configuration.  [Does Kate see
blue-shifted FeII* in absorption?]  This provides an empirical
demonstration that collsioinal excitation is insignificant, and by
inference one may neglect collisional de-excitation.  Meanwhile, the
critical density and excitation energies for \ion{Mg}{2} are $n_c =
??, T_{\rm ex} \approx 50,000$\,K.  

\subsection{The Source}

Nearly all of the absorption studies on cool-gas outflows 
have focused on intensely, star-forming galaxies.  The
intrinsic emisison of these galaxies is a complex combination of
stars and \ion{H}{2} regions that is then modulated by dust and gas
within the galaxy's ISM.  In terms of the spectral regions studied
here, most stars show a featureless continuum with a few spectral
types showing significant \ion{Mg}{2} and \ion{Fe}{2} absorption.
[Any emission??]  \ion{H}{2} regions, meanwhile, are observed to emit
at the \mgiid\ doublet, primarily due to recombinations in the outer
layers [How about FeII?].  It is beyond the scope of this paper to
properly model the 
stellar absorption and \ion{H}{2} region emission, but the reader
should be aware that they can complicate the observed spectrum,
independent of a galactic outflow.
In the following, we will simply assume a flat continuum 
normalized to unit value.  The size of the emitting
region $r_{\rm source}$, however, is a variable parameter.

\section{A Fiducial Wind Model}
\label{sec:fiducial}

In this section, we explore a simple yet illustrative wind model for
a galactic-scale outflow.  The properties of this wind were tuned, in
part, to yield a \ion{Mg}{2} absorption profile 
simlar to that observed toward $z<1$, star-forming galaxies
\citep{wcp+09,rubin10b}.  We emphasize, however, that we do not
favor this fiducial model over any other wind scenario nor are its
properties any more physically motivated. 
Its primary purpose is to establish a baseline for exploration.

The fiducial wind follows a density law

\begin{equation}
n_{\rm H} (r) = \frac{n^0_{\rm H}}{r^2}
\end{equation}
(mass-flux conserving) and a velocity law

\begin{equation}
v_r (r) = v_0 r
\end{equation}
which corresponds to a purely radial flow.  Turbulent motions are
characterized by a Doppler parameter $b_{\rm turb}$.  
The wind is isotropic, dust-free, and extends from an inner wind
radius $r_{\rm inner}$ to an outer wind radius $r_{\rm outer}$.  At
the center of the wind 
is a homogenous source of continuum photons with size $r_{\rm source}$.  Lastly,
we convert the hydrogen density $n_{\rm H}$ to the number density of
Mg$^+$ and Fe$^+$ ions by assuming solar relative abundances with an
absolute metallicity of 1/2 solar and depletion factors of 1/10 and
1/20 for Mg and Fe respectively, i.e.\  $\mnmg = 10^{-5.47} n_{\rm H}$ 
and \nfe=\nmg/2.   
These normalizations give a wind with a peak optical depth $\tau
>> 1$ to \mgiia\ that becomes optically thin over a velocity range
spanning $v_r \approx 100 - 1000 \, \mkms$.  
All of the parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:fiducial}.  

In Figure~\ref{fig:fiducial_nvt} we plot the density and velocity
profiles against radius for the fiducial wind model;  
their single power-law expressions are evident.  The figure also
shows the optical depth for the \mgiia\ transition ($\tau_{2796}$).
Although plotted against radius, we calcualted $\tau_{2796}$ by
summing the opacity as a function of velocity in discrete and small radial intervals
between $r_{\rm inner}$  and $r_{\rm outer}$.   It was then mapped
onto radius using the radial velocity profile. 
The curve agrees well with that derived using the Sobolev approximation.
We emphasize that the optical depth vs.\ velocity are the primary
factors that establish the absorption/emission profiles of the
\ion{Mg}{2} and \ion{Fe}{2} transitions.  In this respect, the 
parameters that establish the size of the wind (and source) are
essentially arbitrary.   In contrast, the adopted Doppler paramter
($b_{\rm turb} = 15 \mkms$) does have a modest impact on the optical
depth profile, especially at large optical depths.  A larger/smaller
value would imply ... [FILL IN]
In turn, this would affect the resulting emission profiles.

The $\tau_{2796}$ profile peaks at $\tau_{2796}^{\rm max} \approx 30$
at a velocity $v \approx 65 \mkms$ corresponding to $r \approx 1.3
r_{\rm inner}$.  The optical depth profiles for the \mgiib\ transition
is identicaly but scaled down by the ratio of $f\lambda$.  Similarly,
the optcial depth profiles for the \ion{Fe}{2} resonance lines are
scaled by $f \lambda$ and the \nfe/\nmg\ ratio.  

Using the methodology described in $\S$~\ref{sec:method}, we
propogated photons from the source and through the outflow to an
`observer' at $r \gg r_{\rm outer}$ that views the entire wind+source
complex.  In Figure~\ref{fig:fiducial_1d}, we present the spectrum
that this observer would record with the unattenuated source spectrum
normalized to unit value.   Consider first the \ion{Mg}{2} profiles;
these show the canonical P-Cygni profiles that characterize a 
source embedded within an outflow.  Strong absorption is evident at
$v < -50 \mkms$ in both transitions and each shows emission at
positive velocities.  For this isotropic and dust-free model, the
total equivalent width of the doublet must be zero
(Table~\ref{tab:fiducial_EW}), i.e.\ every photon
absorbed escapes the system at another energy, primarily at lower
frequency.  The wind simply shuffles photons in frequency space.

Focusing on the \ion{Mg}{2} absorption profiles, one notes they have
similar and non-zero depth even though their $f\lambda$ values differ
by a factor of two.  In absorption line analysis, this is generally
the tell-tale signature of a gas that has a high optical depth (i.e.\
saturated) but only partially covers the emitting source
\citep[e.g.][]{hamman10}.  In this fiducial model, however, the wind
entirely covers the source and the observed behaviour is unrelated to
any partial covering.  Figure~\ref{fig:noemiss}, which compares the
absorption profiles as derived and in the limit where photons are not
re-emitted, shows this explicitly.   One notes that the no-emission
case has a pair of strong absorption lines that absorb all photons at
$v \approx -100 \mkms$, i.e.\ these profiles are simply $\exp(-\tau)$
with $\tau$ given by the curve in Figure~\ref{fig:fiducial_nvt}.  
The actual profile, meanwhile, has been `filled in' at $v \approx -100
\mkms$ by photons scattered and re-emitted by the wind.  An
absorption-line analysis that ignores these effects
\citep[e.g.][]{sato} would systematically underestimate the true optical
depth and falsely conclude partial covering.  [MORE?]
[Dan's analytic calculation here?]

One also notes that the emission profiles of the \mgiid\ doublet
are very similar and have comparable equivalent widths.  In fact the
flux of the \mgiib\ transition even exceeds that for \mgiia.  The
profiles are similar because the absorption is saturated.
Furthermore, the flux from \mgiib\ is greater than that for
\mgiia\ because the wind speed exceeds the velocity separation
of the doublet $|\mvr|_{\rm max} > (\Delta v)_{\rm MgII}$ such
that the \mgiib\ absorption profile absorbs the red wing of the
\mgiia\ emission profile.  The relative strengths of these emission
lines, therefore, is sensitive to both the optical depth and velocity
extent of the wind.

The bottom left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:fiducial_1d} covers the
majority of the \ion{Fe}{2} UV1 transitions.  Several of these are
shown individually in the velocity plot on the right.  The line
profiles for \feiib\ is very similar to those of the \mgiid\ doublet;
one observes strong absorption to negative velocities and strong
emission at $v > 0 \mkms$ producing the P-Cygni profile.  Splitting
the profile at $v = -50 \mkms$, we measure an equivalent width
$W_{2600}^{\rm abs} = 1.19$\AA\ in absorption and $W_{2600}^{\rm em} =
-0.84$\AA\ in emission (Table~\ref{tab:fiducial_EW}) for a total
equivalent width of $W_{2600}^{\rm TOT} \approx 0.35$\AA.  
[Point out that if $\tau_{2600}$ were higher, than the photons would
likely be more trapped and more would come out as 2626.  Also a
v=0km/s component might make quite a difference.]
In contrast, the \feiia\ resonance line shows much weaker emission and
a much higher total equivalent width ($W_{2586}^{\rm TOT} = XX$\AA).
The differences related directly to Einstein coefficients for the
transitions connecting the upper levels of \feiid\ to the 
fine-structure levels of a~$^6$D.  In the case of \feiib, the
\ion{Fe}{2}~2626 transition that returns to the a~$^6$D$_{7/2}$
excited level has an $\approx 4\times$ smaller coefficient than the
resonance line.  Therefore, the majority of photons absorbed at
$\lambda 2600$ are re-emitted with the same energy and only scatter 
in frequency space around the line.  For \feiia, the transitions to
the a~$^6$D$_{7/2}$ and a~$^6$D$_{5/2}$ levels have comparable and
even larger A coefficients than that to the ground-state.  Therefore,
the majority of photons absorbed at $\lambda 2586$ are re-emitted 
as longer wavelength \ion{Fe}{2}~$\lambda 2612$ or $\lambda 2632$
photons.  [Comment on total EW for 2586?]

[Does the FeII 2600 P-Cygni go away if we increase $\tau_{2600}$?]

[Update the EW values with the new FeII data]


Our algorithm tracks the spatial emissivity of the source+wind
complex as a function of frequency.  Therefore, it is straightforward
to construct surface-brightness maps of the emission yielding a
dataset analagous to intergral-field-unit (IFU) observations.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:fig_fiducial_ifu_mgii}, we present the output for our
fiducial wind model at several velocities relative to the \mgiia\
transition. At $\mvr \le -200 \mkms$, where the wind has an optical
depth $\tau_{2796} < 1$ (Figure~\ref{fig:fig_fiducial_nvt}),
the source contributes significantly to the observed flux.  
At $\mvr=-100 \mkms$, however, the
wind absorbs all photons from the source and the observed emission is
entirely due to photons scattered by the wind.  This
emission significantly exceeds that for $\mvr = -200\mkms$ which
explains the fact that the absorption peaks at a velocity offset from
the peak in the wind's optical depth. [word] At $v_{\rm r} \ge 0
\mkms$,  both the source and wind contribute to the observed emission.
